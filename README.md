# SaveTheKuikka

A web application using React (TypeScript) and Express.

The app displays information about drone pilots who are violating the No Drone Zone around a rare and endangered Monadikuikka. Information is persisted for 10 minutes since their drone is last seen in the NDZ. The distance displayed is the closest one to the nest.

Pilots can be sorted by time (newest or oldest first) or distance (closest or farthest first).

A production version of the application is currently running in [https://savethekuikka.fly.dev/](https://savethekuikka.fly.dev/).
